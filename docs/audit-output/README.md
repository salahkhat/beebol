# Audit Output

This folder will contain screenshots and a `report.json` generated by the automated audit script.

How to run the automated audit (Playwright required):

1. Install dependencies (at project root):

```bash
npm install -D playwright
# or if you prefer to install only in the audit folder
# npm --prefix tools/audit install playwright
```

2. Start the web dev server (defaults to port 3000):

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run the audit script from project root:

```bash
npm run audit:mobile
```

4. Results will be under `docs/audit-output/screenshots` and `docs/audit-output/report.json`.

Notes:
- Set `BASE_URL` env var to point the audit to a different server (e.g., staging) e.g. `BASE_URL=https://example.com npm run audit:mobile`.
- If you want, I can install Playwright and run the audit here; say "run the audit" to authorize me to install and execute it.
